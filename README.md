# Homebrew Language Technology tap

This tap is designed specifically for a custom build of Nginx with more module options.


## Installation

Run the following in your command-line:

    brew tap rtxanson/language-technology

Then install one of the formulas.

## Why submit modules here?

Rather than submitting modules to the core Homebrew Formulas, this serves as a
place to make sure people working in language technology are paying attention
to updates, and aware of the challenges in compiling and maintaining some of
this software.

## How to submit?

For now, follow the guidelines for [Homebrew][req]. For now this is a good
starting point, but if it turns out these are too strenuous, I'm open for
discussion!
